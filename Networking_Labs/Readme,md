# Networking Home Lab (CCNA-Level Practice)

## Overview
This repository documents hands-on networking practice performed using Cisco Packet Tracer. The lab focuses on core networking concepts including routing, switching, IP addressing, VLANs, and basic troubleshooting.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Virtualized lab environment

## Key Networking Concepts Practiced

### Switching & LAN
- VLAN configuration
- Access and trunk ports
- Basic switch security concepts
- Route and Switch configuration

### Routing
- Static routing
- Dynamic routing (RIP, OSPF, Eigrp)
- Default gateway configuration
- Routing interface configuration

### IP Addressing
- IPv4 addressing and subnetting
- DHCP and Dns configuration
- IP conflict identification

### Network Services
- DNS concepts (basic)
- Basic NAT configuration
- Device management and configuration access

### Troubleshooting Scenarios
- Connectivity issues between networks
- Incorrect VLAN assignments
- Routing table misconfigurations
- IP addressing errors

## What I Learned
- How data flows across switches and routers
- Importance of correct IP planning
- Structured approach to network troubleshooting
- Verification using show and ping/traceroute commands
- Practice real-time routing scenarios
- Integrate real Linux and Windows hosts
